exp reports ideas

- create report / select report / etc have to return the ID column from db (primary key)
- ability to delete reports (or move to trash?)
- hide input area until there's a report open
- there should be a 'currentReport' type variable (Report class?) with an ID field
- simple to load and save report rows all we need in that table is ID of report
- need input validation / sanitization / overflow prevention
- mobile optimization is key
- Report IDs are not sequential after one is deleted in the middle - may be a problem

next step: clicking a report spits out every corresponding line to console

- title at top with ALL info - T+ timer in the top right corner
- new experience button replaced with close & delete buttons
- add report button should.. 
	append to list 
	refresh list
	scroll list to new report
	highlight current report
	replace itself with 'close' and 'delete' buttons
