exp reports ideas

- enter button handling
- create report / select report / etc have to return the ID column from db (primary key)
- there should be a 'currentReport' type variable (Report class?) with an ID field
- need input validation / sanitization / overflow prevention
- mobile optimization is key
- Report IDs are not sequential after one is deleted in the middle - may be a problem
- Clean up default HTML favicon.ico request (@route '/favicon.ico' OR just convert PNG and serve both)
- display area scrolling

next step: deleting report lines

- title at top with ALL info - T+ timer in the top right corner
- add report button should.. 
	X append to list 
	X refresh list
	scroll list to new report
	highlight current report
	X show input area if hidden
	replace itself with 'close' and 'delete' buttons
